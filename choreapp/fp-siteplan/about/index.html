      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why Chore Champion?</h2>
      <div class="m-2">
        <p>The first benefit of our app is that it helps reduce conflict between parents and children. The app serves as
          the middleman between the parent and child so that parents don't have to personally confront the child about
          chores. This is done because instead of the child getting all the chores from their parents, they get their
          chores from a list in the app. The kids can easily see all the chores they have to do without having to be
          told by their parents. The app also motivates the child to do the chores instead of having to be from their
          parents. Every time that the child completes a chore, they are rewarded with points. These points can be
          redeemed for an allowance, more screen time, or a fun event such as laser tag. These fun prizes would motivate
          the child to do the chores so that the parent doesn't have to be the bad guy and make them do their chores. By
          not being the bad guy every day, lots of conflicts will be avoided.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Another benefit to the app is that it motivates kids to do the chores around the house that never get done.
          In a lot of houses, there are chores that need to be done, but never do because nobody wants to actually do
          them. If these chores that never get done are put into the app, and there is an actual reward to do them, then
          the children will be far more likely to do them. This would be really good for the parents because then all
          the things that they don&rsquo;t have time to do will finally be done. This is also really good for the kids
          because, without the app, the kids would probably have to do it anyway, but now they are getting rewards. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The
          last benefit of the app is that it makes chores fun for kids. For young kids, most of their life is fun and
          play. Even school at a young age is mostly fun. One of the only things that aren't fun is their chores, so
          they hate them. Chores can cause children to tantrum and put them in a bad mood. Since Chore Champion is so
          effective in solving this issue it will push kids and parents to continue using the app.</p>
